# Overview of Liftoff Project 2021

###This project is a user-friendly map of affordable housing units available through a nonprofit.  
 User Stories
- User Map: public Users will be able to view affordable housing communities and units on a dynamic map
- Search: public Users will be able to search with a search bar for housing location
- Edit Map: Nonprofit users will be able to use CRUD functionality to manage the map
- apply: public users will be able to join the wait list for affordable housing
- Public user will be able to search for housing with category tools

## Users
Public users: any member of the public will have access to this portion of the website. Likely public users are caseworkers for homeless individuals  
  
Nonprofit users: This private portion of the website will be for members of the nonprofit client only. There will be a password to access this portion of the site and users with access will be able to edit the housing site data. 

  
  ## More Notes
- housing data will be stored using SQL in a database (MySQL) (need to add dependency)
- The map will mostly likely be created with google maps and a javascript library 
- some form of security will need to be used to protect any basic data collected from wait list app
